      or a legal wrapper template.

  Purpose:
    - Present the Terms of Service in a clear, readable, and structured format.
    - Outline usage conditions, license, availability, responsibilities, termination,
      and contact details for Supporter Bot.

  Layout & Styling:
    - Root wrapper: .legal-container
    - Header: .legal-header with gradient main title and "last updated" line.
    - Body: .legal-content.glass-card with sectioned legal text.
    - Relies on external CSS (e.g., legal.css / terms.css) for:
      - Glassmorphism card styling (glass-card)
      - Gradient typography (gradient-text)
      - Spacing utilities (p-8, etc.)

  Integration Points:
    - Typically used inside a Jinja/Flask or other templating engine layout.
    - Contact link routes to /contact (or equivalent route defined in backend).
