  Description:
    - Reusable content block for the Privacy Policy page of Supporter Bot.
    - Designed to be embedded inside a higher-level layout (e.g., privacy_policy.html)
      or a legal wrapper template.

  Purpose:
    - Clearly describe what data Supporter Bot collects, how it is used,
      where it is stored, and what rights users have.
    - Provide transparency for Discord server owners and members regarding
      privacy and data handling practices.

  Layout & Styling:
    - Root wrapper: .legal-container
    - Header: .legal-header with gradient main title and "last updated" line.
    - Body: .legal-content.glass-card with sectioned legal text and lists.
    - Relies on external CSS (e.g., legal.css / privacy_policy.css) for:
      - Glassmorphism card styling (glass-card)
      - Gradient typography (gradient-text)
      - Spacing utilities (p-8, etc.)

  Integration Points:
    - Intended for use within a templated layout (e.g., Flask/Jinja, Node, etc.).
    - External links:
        - YouTube Terms of Service
        - Google Privacy Policy
    - Can be combined with a site-wide footer and navigation for a full page.
